    <!-- SECTION 2 in this section i started with a header so the user would be aware of what was 
coming next, the i proceeded with quick paragraph about preparation.-->
    <section>
      <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
      <p>
        You’ll need a whelping box in a quiet, temperature-controlled room with
        a door to keep mom in and other animals out. Whelping Box: A space
        designed for dogs to give birth and raise their puppies until their eyes
        and ears open around 2-3 weeks old. You can purchase a whelping box, or
        make something as easy as a kennel with a kiddie pool and blanket.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3 in this section i want to give the user an unorganized checklist of things they will
need for their whelping box and then also add pictures for examples-->
    <section>
      <h2>Whelping Box Checklist</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Large enough room for mom to fully spread out, and get in and out
          easily
        </li>
        <li>
          Some kind of bumper between the mom and the side of the box that
          prevents the mother from accidentally smushing the puppies against the
          side
        </li>
        <li>Easy to clean and sanitize floor</li>
        <li>
          Lots of blankets, whelping is messy and the fluids will get everywhere
          and smell terrible, be sure to have enough blankets to change
          frequently
        </li>
        <li>
          Temperature in the room should be around 75°F/24°C with no drafts, you
          made need to provide supplimental heat, becareful using a space heater
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 4 here i wanted the user to be aware of how important note taking is, and there for i 
provided an organizedlist of things that are important to keep tract of and the order in which they happen -->
    <section>
      <h2>Take Notes</h2>
      <h4>
        Good notes are valuable to your veterinarian in case of an emergency,
        note the date and time of the following whelping events in a Whelping
        Log.
      </h4>

        <ol>
          <li>Temperature drops</li>
          <li>Nesting begins</li>
          <li>Appetite diminishes</li>
          <li>Panting starts</li>
          <li>Abdominal straining observed</li>
          <li>Appearance of green, black or reddish-brown vaginal fluid</li>
          <li>When each puppy first appears in birth canal</li>
          <li>When each puppy is fully out of birth canal</li>
        </ol>
      </p2>

    <!-- SECTION 5 lastly its important to know when to worry and when not to worry, here i provided 
two lists for protocol in case of an emergency and in non emergency cases -->
    <section>
      <h2>How to Predict when Whelping will Occur</h2>
      <p>
        The average dog pregnancy lasts about 63 days (9 weeks). I’m not going
        to go very deeply into breeding strategies but if you’re dealing with a
        planned pregnancy and you know when your dog ovulated you can predict
        whelping within a day or two. Ovulation can be predicted by changes in
        progesterone or luteinizing hormones. Labor can also be predicted by
        measuring progesterone because a drop will occur 12-36 hours before
        labor begins. However, these methods require multiple trips to the vet
        for blood draws which equals more time, money and stress on your dog.
        The dame will do all of the work when it comes to birthing the puppies.
